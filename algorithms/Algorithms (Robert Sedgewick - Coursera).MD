## 1.1 Union-Find Problem

(section 1.5 of the book)

**Union-Find Problem** (UF) is a set of algorithms for solving the **dynamic connectivity** problem. We'll look at two classic algorithms, **Quick Find** and **Quick Union**.

### 1.1.1 General Steps

First let's go through the steps that we will follow over and over again to develop a useful algorithm.

* Model the problem: understand the main elements.
* Find an algorithm to solve it.
* Check whether it's fast enough and it fits in memory.
* If not, figure out why.
* Find a way to address the problem.
* Iterate until satisfied.

### 1.1.2 Dynamic Connectivity

Model:

Given a set of N objects, and two commands:

* Union: connect two objects;
* Find query: is there a path connecting the two objects?

Assume "is connected to" is an equivalence relation:

* Reflexive
* Symmetric
* Transitive
