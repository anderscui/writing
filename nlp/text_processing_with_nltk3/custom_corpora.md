# Creating Custom Corpora

We will cover how to use corpus readers and create custom corpora. If we want to train our own model, such as POS tagger or text classifier, we will need to create a custom corpus to train on.

We will also cover creating custom readers, which can be used when tghe corpus is not in a compatible format or not located in a database such as MongoDB.

## Setting up a custom corpus

A **corpus** is a collection of text documents, and **corpara** is the plural of corpus. This comes from the Latin word for body; in this case, a body of text.
