In this project, I will learn methods that do not cluster objects, but put them into a small number of groups called topics.

The subfield of machine learning that deals with these problems is called topic modeling.

The simplest topic model is LDA:
LDA: Latent Dirichlet Allocation
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model


Our task is to take a collection of text and reverse engineer this fable in order to discover what topics are out there
and also where each document belongs.


scikit-learn does not contain LDA impl, so here I use the gensim package which is developed by Radim Rehurek.


The dataset we will use is AP (Associated Press) of news reports.
