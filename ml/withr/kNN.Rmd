We will utilize the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic" dataset from *UCI Machine Learning Repository*.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:
