Embedding R codes in Rmd file.

Here, we're going to write some R codes.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Let's make a plot of the data.

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here is a regression model of ozone on wind.

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
summary(fit)
```
