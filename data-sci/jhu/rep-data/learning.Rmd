## What is R Markdown?

* R markdown is the integration of R with Markdown
* Allows one to create documents containing "live" R code
* A core tool in literate statistical programming

* RM can be converted to standard markdown using the knitr package
* RM -> markdown -> HTML work flow can be managed by RStudio
* RM can be converted to slides using [slidify](http://slidify.org/) package.

```{r}
v <- vector()
v <- append(v, c(3, 2, 1))
print(v)
```

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
