## Synopisis

In this document, I will show you an analysis of storms and other severe weather 
events in the United States. The data set comes from NOAA which tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States during 1950 to 2011.

At the end of this document, I will show you:

- Which types of events are most harmful for population health
- Which types of events have the greatest economic consequences

## Data Processing

First, let's read the data set.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
setwd("D:/andersc/r/")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
